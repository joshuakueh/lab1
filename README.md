# Notes
- Having lots of different and seperate docs in a project will take up lots of disc space, that is why we need proper versioning convention.
- In software versioning, each of the numbers have a specific meaning.
- In software versioning, the first digit is a major release that is incompatible with pervious verions.
- In software versioning, the second digit is a minor release that guarantees backwards compatibility and adds additional features.
- In software versioning, the third digit is a pacth for bug fixes.
- A virtual environment is a virtual isolation of a python version and its installed packages.
- A virtual environment is dedicated to each project as it allows compatibility after the first digit in software version changes. eg. 1.23.1 to 2.10.2
# Reflection
**I have learned that each digit within the software version has a specific meaning to it, and what those digits mean. I also learned what a virtual environment is and its importance during projects. I have also learned what Github is and how to use markdown.**
# Solution to Lab Activity
## Question 1
**The probability of winning a game would be 1/100.**
## Question 2
**It is still not possible to win every game even with the debugging feature on.**
